## üîç Overview
This project centers on performing a **descriptive analysis of the Formula 1 World Championship** to uncover how constructor teams have performed and evolved over time. Using over decades of race data (1950‚Äì2024), the analysis focuses on key performance metrics such as constructor points, rankings, driver contributions, and overall team success.

By transforming raw historical data into a clean, structured format and presenting it through interactive Tableau dashboards, the project helps audiences explore trends, comparisons, and patterns with clarity. It aims to provide data-backed insights for F1 fans, analysts, and enthusiasts looking to understand the sport beyond surface-level statistics.

The dashboard highlights:
- Seasonal trends in points and wins for each constructor.
- How individual drivers impact team success.
- Shifts in team rankings across different F1 eras.
- Navigate race outcomes season by season.

## ‚ùó Problem Statement
Despite being one of the most data-rich sports globally, Formula 1's historical data is often fragmented, complex, and difficult to interpret without technical expertise. This project addresses that gap by transforming raw F1 data into clear, interactive visuals‚Äîempowering users to uncover trends, evaluate performance, and explore strategic narratives across the sport‚Äôs rich history.

The primary objective is to surface meaningful insights across four core dimensions of F1:

  - Driver performance over time and across teams.
  - Constructor success and their dominance across seasons.
  - Circuit-level dynamics, such as race frequency and outcomes.
  - Qualifying metrics and starting grid advantages.

Through comprehensive dashboards, users can answer questions like:

  - How have dominant teams and drivers shifted over decades?
  - Which circuits are most historic or frequently raced?
  - What trends exist in pole positions and qualifying outcomes?
  - What nationalities have led F1 podium finishes?

This unified approach not only streamlines exploration but enhances strategic analysis and fan engagement through visual storytelling.

## üß© Dataset Description
The data for this project was sourced from the Formula 1 World Championship dataset published by Rohan Rao on **Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020/data)**. This dataset compiles comprehensive historical Formula 1 data from 1950 to 2024, originally extracted and curated from the official Ergast Developer API, a well-known and regularly updated public database of F1 race results and statistics.
